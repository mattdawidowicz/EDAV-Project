# EDAV-Project

Guide to files:

Moon Illusion Final Project Notebook.nb.html: a copy of this file
Moon Illusion Final Project Notebook.rmd: the code for this file
Graph1.png: the correlation matrix picture...if you need to recreate this notebook with the RMD file.
Graph2.png: the correlation matrix/distribution picture...if you need to recreate this notebook with the RMD file.
ui.r: the first file that makes up Shiny; tells the app what tabs to make and what to place in them
server.r: the second file that makes up Shiny; contains the actual code used to make the graphs
EDAV-State-Data.csv: the complete data table, if you would like to see the original CSV

We have redone the code to allow it to run locally so as not to mess with the published version. Just open either r file in RStudio and press "Run App". If any packages need installing, uncomment the appropriate lines.
